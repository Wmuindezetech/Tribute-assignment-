            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <div class="bio-content">
                <p>Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on July 18, 1918, in the village of Mvezo in South Africa. He became one of the most revered figures in modern history, dedicating his life to the fight against apartheid and the pursuit of equality, justice, and human dignity for all people.</p>
                
                <p>Mandela's journey from a rural village to becoming South Africa's first Black president is a testament to his unwavering commitment to justice. He studied law at the University of Fort Hare and the University of the Witwatersrand, where he became involved in anti-colonial politics and joined the African National Congress (ANC) in 1944.</p>
                
                <p>For his activism against the apartheid government, Mandela was imprisoned for 27 years, from 1962 to 1990. Rather than breaking his spirit, this experience strengthened his resolve and made him a global symbol of resistance to oppression. His release from prison marked the beginning of South Africa's transition to democracy.</p>
                
                <p>In 1994, Mandela was elected as South Africa's first Black president in the country's first fully representative democratic election. His presidency was marked by efforts to dismantle the legacy of apartheid through reconciliation and the establishment of a "Rainbow Nation" where all races could coexist peacefully.</p>
                
                <p>Mandela's legacy extends far beyond South Africa. He became a global icon of peace, reconciliation, and human rights, inspiring movements for justice around the world. His philosophy of forgiveness over revenge helped heal a nation and showed the world the power of reconciliation.</p>

            <div class="bio-content">
                <p>Nelson Mandela's legacy transcends borders and generations. His unwavering commitment to justice, equality, and human dignity transformed not only South Africa but inspired liberation movements and human rights advocates worldwide. His philosophy of reconciliation over revenge showed the world that even the deepest wounds can heal through forgiveness and understanding.</p>
                
                <p>The Nelson Mandela Foundation continues his work in promoting social justice and human rights. Mandela Day, celebrated annually on July 18th, encourages people worldwide to dedicate 67 minutes of their time to helping others – representing the 67 years Mandela devoted to public service.</p>
                
                <p>His autobiography, "Long Walk to Freedom," remains one of the most influential memoirs of the 20th century. His speeches and writings continue to inspire leaders, activists, and ordinary citizens who seek to create a more just and equitable world.</p>
                
                <p>Perhaps Mandela's greatest legacy is the proof that change is possible – that systems of oppression can be dismantled through courage, persistence, and moral leadership. His life demonstrates that one person, armed with conviction and compassion, can indeed change the world. As he once said, "It always seems impossible until it's done."</p>
